# HiBot-v1
HiBot is a playground of whimsy for a mobile, battery operated Feather-Huzzah-and-TFT-screen device.

When you have built the HiBot, which is a simple device that consists of one Adafruit Feather Huzzah, one 240x320 TFT screen, two buttons, and a lipo battery... then this code brings the device to life with a small package of goofy games and classic programmer exercises to liven up your living room table:
* Conway's Game of Life
* One-person Pong, with scoreboard
* Various psychedelic, kinetic graphical transformations to look at and smile.
